Objective: To place all the cards in their corresponding suit pile panel  in the order of Ace to King with King on top
Controls: 
1.) The player can drag a single card from the subdrawpile panel and the suit pile panels in the suit piles field. If the player chooses the option of having 3 cards in the subdrawpile panel, still the same rules apply, only one card can be dragged at a time and the other cards can only be dragged if the previous card was removed
2.) The player can drag single or multiple cards from the pile panels in the piles field
3.) The player can only click a single card from the main draw pile panel. 
If however this panel became empty, clicking its background picture (the joker) will move all the cards from the subdrawpile panel into the maindrawpile panel
Nominal Rank (from lowest to greatest):
Ace, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen, King 
Restrictions:
1.) The player can not push any card/s into the maindrawpile panel or subdrawpile panel which are both inside the drawpileholder panel
2.) (Not implemented yet) All Face down card/s that is/are either dragged as one or along other cards can not be dragged from their position. (Already implemented) Push (adding a card into a pile) or pop (removing a card from a pile) that involves face down cards are not allowed.
3.) Every push into the suit pile panels are checked such that the last card in the suit pile panel, the panel where the card will be pushed, must have a lower nominal rank than the card that the player wants to push into the suit pile panel.   
4.) Every push into the pile panels are checked such that the last card in the pile panel, the panel where the card will be pushed, must have a higher nominal rank than the card that the player wants to push into the pile panel and their color must also vary (with one being red and the other black).
